ODeSA_Scan.

Fresh_rewrite is the new version that I wrote based on the original one provided by Mike F. 
As of Dec 04 2021, this branch works but needs validation

the original code is stored in the "original" branch

Example of how to run :
    ./odesa_wavedump_scan -n 8 -h <"header information"> -o <output-file> -i <input-file-prefix> -b -d

Help Menu exists with " ./odesa_wavedump_scan -h " or " ./odesa_wavedump_scan --help "
